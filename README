LaserCAM

This is a .Net Windows App that will read an SVG file containing both
vector and bitmap shapes and convert it into GCode suitable for driving
a laser cutter. This code was developed to drive an inexpensive Chinese
laser from Mach3 and works quite well for vector shapes. The raster
suffers from being too slow and doesn't control the laser on/off fast
enough so there's uneven power applied.

But compared to the horrific software that came with the machine, this
produces smooth cuts that are an order of magnitude more precise.
